# Exceptionist

Exceptionist tries to provide more control over which exceptions are thrown without losing any important information. It's providing a simple logging mechanism for objects to save all its exceptions and control which one of those should actually be thrown when the object is executed. 

## Requirements

Exceptionist is currently developed and designed around PHP 7.3. Earlier versions are not tested and for now not planned to be supported. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is required.

## Install

### Composer

[Install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) on your system and run:

`composer require crystlbrd/exceptionist`

### Manually

It is not recommended to install it manually, but theoretically possible. This is only for completeness.

Download the zip or clone the repository into the directory you want Exceptionist to be in and set up the namespaces for your project. `crystlbrd\Exceptionist\` should point into the /src/ directory of Exceptionist.
